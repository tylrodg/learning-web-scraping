# Learning Web Scraping
This is a collection of scripts I wrote while learning web scraping for my upcoming project on predicting late flights.

## BeautifulSoup Tutorial
I followed (partially) a tutorial at http://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (original was for Python 2 and went through many introductory steps that I skipped)

## Late Flight Data
Uses Selenium to download CSVs of delayed flight data from https://transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236
